% This file is about structuring thoughts about doing the last part of the thesis.
% I still need to write about sustainability issues, the conclusion and discussion and the results of the analyses.
% The major obstacle is that I seem to not have enough data to write about sustainability

One option could be to break it up in 2 parts: sustainability of paludiculture versus current intensive dairy farming and on the other hand best sustainable practices of paludiculture, which can be different per situation.


% main question: what sustainability bottlenecks and opportunities need to be accounted for? 
% sub question: what social, economic and ecological bottlenecks and opportunities are there?
% sub question: what spatial and temporal bottlenecks and opportunities are there?

\subsection{Money}
With intensive dairy farming, per hectare, a farmer can earn ... euros. The costs are per hectare ... On average, an intensive dairy farmer receives .. euros of subsidies from the governments per hectare. Land prices are ... per hectare. At the moment, one of the most profitable paludiculture crops is peat moss, with which ... euros can be made. Costs are as high as .. No subsidies are given to paludiculture farmers. 

However, if ecosystem services costs and benefits would be accounted for, paludiculture is more profitable than intensive dairy farming. \citet{born} calculated that costs of drainage in rural areas to infrastructure are ... per year. 

\subsection{Ecological factors}
% Low lying nature conservation
In the Netherlands, a number of nature conservation areas lie in peatlands. These areas often have a higher elevation than their surroundings. That causes seepage from water away from the nature area, resulting in drougths and high costs to keep the water in. Paludiculture as buffers around nature areas are mentioned as a good alternative to prevent seepage from nature areas, and also to function as a bufferzone for aquatic fauna species such as the aquatic warbler. 

% Water storage after extreme weather circumstances
Besides acting as a nature bufferzone, paludiculture areas can be used as water storage bufferzones, in case of extreme rainfall, which is expected to happen more frequently in the future. 

% Nutrient filtering
Surface waters in the Netherlands are often eutrophied due to nutrient runoff after intensive fertilizer and manure application in agricultural fields. In special, N and P are abundently available in surface waters, causing algae and other plants to bloom. As a result, waters can be deprived of oxygen, resulting in death of aquatic fauna. Paludiculture crops have shown to be able to thrive under these high nutrient conditions. Waters can be cleaned by paludiculture crops, which is already done in waste water treatment plants. Broadleaf cattail can extract upto ... kg N and ... kg P per hectare. Common reed shows similar results.
